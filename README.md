Generating human faces with Adversarial Networks


A generative adversarial network is a class of machine learning frameworks designed by Ian Goodfellow and his colleagues in 2014  [Paper](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/2014/file/5ca3e9b122f61f8f06494c97b1afccf3-Paper.pdf)


Generative adversarial networks (GANs) are algorithmic architectures that use two neural networks, pitting one against the other (thus the “adversarial”) in order to generate new, synthetic instances of data that can pass for real data. They are used widely in image ,video  and voice generation.
